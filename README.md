# Testcases POC

In this POC we have covered the unittest cases and pytest test libracies.

# Instatiation

Create a new virtualenv and then install all the required packages from the requirement.txt file

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

# Unittest 

For running the unit test via unittest runner use the below command

```
python -m unittest test_unittest_custom_back.py
```

# Pytest
For running the unit test via pytest runner use below command

```
pytest test_pytest_custom_callback.py
```

# Conclusion

I have added some errors and the purpose of adding those errors because with help of those we can find the pytest error detection gives more details are more efficient than unittest for debugging purpose. For pytest is the third party and supports all python latest version where unittest cases are in-build python package.
